# Arena Datapack
###### Version 0.1

## Introduction
This is an efficiency-focused Minecraft datapack for implementing custom arena entities with easy path-finding. An invisible pathfinder entity and a visible follower entity are able to track various targets in accordance with the needs of the current arena scenario/script.

This repo is currently under development for an in-progress Minecraft map. You are welcome to use it under the terms of the license, but I have no guarantees about anything working.
